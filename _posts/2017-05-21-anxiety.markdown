I think it's important to have a routine or script that you can follow if you hit a depressive/anxious day.

Mine is:

1. HALT - Hungry (Eat), Angry (Meditate), Lonely (Call someone), Tired (Nap)
2. Improve your surroundings/gain micro-control - Clean your room / chores
3. Change your surroundings - Go for a walk
4. Exercise (Swimming or Walking)

These actions may not be helpful for everyone, depending on the severity of the mental distress, but these are the main things I've noticed help me when I'm having a particularly rough day.

The main idea is to give yourself default habitual reactions to anxiety that improve your situation.
