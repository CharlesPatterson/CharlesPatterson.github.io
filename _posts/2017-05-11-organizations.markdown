The book Images of Organization by Gareth Morgan provides useful conceptual metaphors for understanding organizations.

Gareth believes that to understand organizations, a multitude of perspectives is necessary, because the all-too-human tendency is to unconsciously choose one metaphor which blinds you to different aspects of the organization.

- Organization as Machine: A closed system, focused on efficiency and capable for repeatable tasks, but not capable of adapting to change. Rigid roles and bureaucracy are a result.
- Organization as Organism: An open system, with a lifecycle, with different species, engaging in competition, vying for homeostasis
- Organization as Brain: A brain is a holographic system (like light patterns that in part are the same as the whole), where the part mimics the whole and can survive without parts, but it also specializes, likewise an organization can be like a network of information systems.
- Organization as Culture: Shared systems of meaning and values shape the actions of employers and employees, making every action of symbolic significance to the meaning of each, and only if the images and meanings change can an organization succeed.
