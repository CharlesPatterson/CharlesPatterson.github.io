Summary:
Jocko believes that to be an effective leader, you should own everything in your world including all responsibility for failure.
You have to believe in the mission while checking your ego.
You have to provide cover for the broader team while moving, keep your plans simple, prioritize and execute, and instill leadership in all members of the team with decentralized command.
To sustain victory, you have to plan, lead up and down the chain of command, exercise decisiveness amid uncertainty, and maintain a high level of discipline.
Leadership is difficult, because it involves balancing myriad characteristics, hence the Dichotomy of Leadership, a series of statements about how a leader must behave in balance.
