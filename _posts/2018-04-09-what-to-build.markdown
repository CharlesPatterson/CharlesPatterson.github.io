What can I build? A junior engineer asked me this, saying he couldn't think of any good personal project idea.

I can relate. The common advice is to scratch an itch, but it's hard to find much itching with all the convenience today.

The greatest motivations in technology for me were the inaccessibility of videogames because of hardware / operating systems issues.

Troubleshooting the videocard and soundcard were imperative for getting to enjoy videogames. Hence, massive amounts of learning around early Windows, DOS.

But now, everything just works; lots of walled gardens, closed systems. I realize that I'm not even talking about product-level creativity.

However, the question of what motivates learning is close enough to what motivates building. Building is a journey made in producing software.

Learning is a journey made in producing mental structures. The problem with the question is usually that the engineer lacks a wide-enough context for discovery of solvable problems.

Maybe slightly better advice: try to find problems or opportunities in the world by going out and doing anything EXCEPT engineering.

Connect to communities of people, they will spark the fires of inspiration with their concerns. 

Not knowing what to build means you live in a closed ghetto of thought, and the best cure for that is exposure to something outside your purview.

Alternative advice: learn more about your tools and they will point you to possibilities in your medium.
